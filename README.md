# Nico Holm - System Administrator

## Overview
I am a System Administrator specializing in process and workflow automation. My experience spans across cloud and hybrid environments, and I am adept at scripting in PowerShell, with proficiency in JavaScript, Python, and C++.

## Skills
- PowerShell for automation tasks
- Managing cloud and hybrid infrastructures (Azure)
- Utilizing Ms Graph to manage Entra ID
- Programming with JavaScript, Python, and C#

## Projects
My projects involve taking data from different sources, normalizing the data and implementing it into other systems.
The usual MO is creating users and security/unified groups based on external data sources (Anything that can produce accessible data) and implementing that to further systems that can leverage Azure/Microsoft authentication or IAM
